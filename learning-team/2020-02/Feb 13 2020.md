## Minutes

### (15min) Coordinate work to add Ember to [https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-stack-packs/tree/master/packs](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-stack-packs/tree/master/packs)

Lighthouse has a "stack pack" that gives you info that is specific to Ember. The person who posted the link needs some help in order to move forward. We should distribute the work to get this done. There are some nuanced things that we (the learning team) would have to decide, but most things, anybody. This was first raised by `vasing#3457`. A leader can be anybody - core team needs to be responsive to their questions.

We need someone to take the lead. We need to check out the other packs and see what keys it has. See which keys apply to Ember. Decide how we want people to address them in Ember, which addons to link to or not, etc. The output we create is one JSON file. Not a lot of work!

Why do this: parity with what other frameworks are doing. Part of Octane strategy.

RM will help with the part of this job that detects whether the app is Ember.

**(10min) Decide if the current TodoMVC ember implementation should be updated for Octane, or a new version added that would coexist. Related: [https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/2098](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/pull/2098)**

RM - There are two implementations currently. One is super custom and another that has been updated recently but it is pre-octane. Real World Ember is on 3.x but is pre-octane.

Decision to make - do we want both and Octane and non-Octane? Could be nice to compare but these implementations aren't comparable. Need to do an Octane-first rewrite.

CM: Alon, Pat, and others worked on things. They decided that it was good to have both.

JW: If people are willing to do the work, whatever seems good. We can suggest that Octane is done first.

CM: This is how it was done for Real World

JW: So our decision is not whether to do both, but whether to *show* both

CM: Real World tends to show multiple "flavors" of apps for other frameworks. Todo MVC is more geared towards showing one

JW: we can encourage them to add clarifying notes

RM: We should probably label them "Ember Classic" and "Ember", or "Ember Classic" and "Ember Octane"

**Conclusion:**

It is up to the implementers to make the decisions, and here are our suggestions to help keep things aligned with the messaging used in emberjs.com:

- Real World MVC makes sense to have multiple "flavors" because this is what other frameworks are doing. We suggest calling the older version "Ember Classic" and the newer Octane version either "Ember" or "Ember Octane"
- Todo MVC tends to show just one flavor for other frameworks and we think it makes sense for it to be Octane
- Whenever it shows multiple versions of Ember, make sure that there are clear descriptions so that someone who has never heard of Ember before isn't confused
