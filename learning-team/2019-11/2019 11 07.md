## Minutes

- discussing the PR about adding accessibility addon to the guides
    - it needs more work before it can be included - and we plan to help them get there
- Demo of the redesign work that @Jen Weber
    - we want all learning team members to review each of these PRs and give feedback **sooner rather than later**
    - Best to not split template into its own repo because contributors may find it confusing
- ember-blog - ask Chris and Kenneth, but probably should just apply them to the ruby app
    - Should leave the blog to the end after we have sorted out other priorities
- Discussion about website release plan
    - the crux of the issue: What do we think the "ember website" refers to?
    - [https://emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com)/*
