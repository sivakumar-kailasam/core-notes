### New Browser Support page (RM, 15min)

PR: https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/745/files

Chris Garrett (@pzuraq) [completed writing the Browser Support page](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/745) as a part of [RFC #685](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/685).

Where do we want to show the page is a topic that was discussed previously. Chris proposed adding the page to the top navigation menu in [emberjs.com](https://emberjs.com/).

#### 1. Questions

- Is top navigation menu the right place? Do we want to, instead, place the link in an existing page?
- How will the choice above affect SEO?

RW: Okay with either choice. People can find the page easily.
JG: Okay with it too.

#### 2. Potential problems

In order to update the top navigation menu, we need to make a pull request in `ember-styleguide` and make a release. `ember-website` currently uses `v4` of `ember-styleguide`, not `v5`. We're unsure yet if upgrading `ember-styleguide` to `v5` may result in breaking changes.

RM: It's okay to merge the [pull request in `ember-website`](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/746), so that it doesn't block work that
we may need to do for `ember-styleguide`.

The `browser-support` page is currently live and people may be able to visit the URL directly. However, since the content applies to a yet-announced Ember version, we may want to consider hiding the page for now.

JW: It'd be helpful if the `browser-support` page can, for now, show the browser support for Ember v3.x. See [Supported Browsers and Features - Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/supported-browsers-features/) for a reference.

#### 3. Action items

1\. Ricardo will ask Chris to see if Chris can update the Browser Support page to show browser support for Ember 3.x.
2a\. If Chris is unable to by Sunday, we'll remove the route.
2b (i)\. If Chris is able to, we'll merge the [temporary solution PR](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-website/pull/746).
2b (ii)\. Afterwards, we make a pull request in `ember-styleguide` to update the links. Jen can help with making a release for `v4` and `v5`.
