## Notes
- next facilitator is probably mel (@Chris M to confirm) 
- Tracking RFC backlog
    - last week we did a few tracking issues
    - 10 issues still need a review (all different sizes)
    - CM - what is considered “done”
        - do a best effort to represent the work that needs to be done and then you can mark it as 👍  done
        - ask yourself: 
            - should this change the guides
            - should this change the api docs
            - does this change any mental models
        - create an issue and link it in the tracking issue
        - done is being tracked in the airtable - Learning Team Airtable - tab at the end
    - doing well overall - working down the backlog
    - there can be some improvements to the RFC tracking overall (e.g. deprecations workflow)
    - Question: should we add issues or add a checkbox on tracking issues to delete deprecated code’s documentation?
        - CM: if we don’t close a tracking issue until documentation is deleted (major release) then too many RFCs will be in progress
        - RM: maybe we create an issue per version to remove code and documentation (based off the until: flag) 
- Octane Navbar Menu?
    - JW: link to editions instead of just Octane? 
    - CM: seems good 😂 
- “Docs team” to “Learning Team” folder for core notes
    - general discussion 
    - merging amy’s PR 🎉 consensus 
- Airtable cleanup workshop 🛠️
