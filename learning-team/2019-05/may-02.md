    - Most burning issues for Octane actionables are here https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/issues/669
- (JW) changes to GitHub PR management process (skipped last week)
- (JW) Octane Guides: how do we mitigate not having a pre-Octane tutorial readily available? It will still be in older Guides versions I guess, but that won’t help us when there’s the next edition. (skipped last week)
- (MS) Proposal: “why Ember” in the same style as kentico.github.io as a first step (since we still haven’t shipped the larger initiative for the same thing)
