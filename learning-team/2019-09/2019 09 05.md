## Minutes

- Tutorial update:
    - Jen paired on the super rentals tutorial
    - Lot of stuff has been automated - but there is still work needed (80% done)
    - Unsure if it's ready for 3.13
- API docs
    - SK - For the current app, it's difficult to merge confidently. Currently working on a rewrite in Octane, as a way to learn Octane too. Will incorporate the new designs and styleguide
    - We need to discuss how to migrate existing apps.
    - MS - We are doing light changes at first for the API docs
    - JW - do we need to wrangle help from other people?
    - MS - no, I think this is a one-weekend, one person kind of job
    - JW - have to watch out for fastboot issues in the API docs. that's what blocked using styleguide in the past
