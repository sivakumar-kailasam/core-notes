## Today's Topics

- AL: Want to get ideas from the team about Octane-focused Ember Times content, see: [https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/261](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-blog/pull/261).
- AL: Put the Ember Times on dev.to, but will need a cover image that works for the site: [https://dev.to/embertimes/the-ember-times-issue-no-114-4f44](https://dev.to/embertimes/the-ember-times-issue-no-114-4f44). For Twitter [https://twitter.com/embertimes](https://twitter.com/embertimes), maybe a solid image of the same color orange would be appropriate?
- AL: Realized I wasn't following "Learning Team" or "Blog" on discuss and am doing that now. Not sure how to respond to this question: [https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-js-the-ember-times-issue-no-112/16992/2](https://discuss.emberjs.com/t/ember-js-the-ember-times-issue-no-112/16992/2) "Interesting stuff with Microstate.js. It’s really true that DDAU is the Ember way, yet Ember itself does quite little to make this way of working easier/safer/more robust. Are there any plans or ideas to improve the experience with DDAU?"

## Minutes

The Times

- AL/RM: the times wants to do a retro of what led up to Octane
- RM: They are also looking for interviewees
- JJ: Would be cool to have a writeup of how something developed over time to be ready to ship. We could show the timeline all the way from ES6 features to the RFC, to implementation & shipping. Helps show to people that things are moving!
- JW: could ask Chris Garrett
- RM: or Yehuda
- JW: we could do some interviews at EmberCamp!
- RM: can also reference Robert Jackson's Ember Weekend talk if it is happening

Dev.to

- AL: The Times is planning to move to dev.to. Who to ping about getting new images?
- RM: Leah
- JW: does this replace goodbits?
- AL: no but it will help with populating the tag

Quirks of Inputs and DDAU

- RM: if you put an Input helper into a glimmer component and pass it the parent arg, the input will be able to mutate it. Will post a Codesandbox
- RM: Octane pushes you to immutable patterns and DDAU
