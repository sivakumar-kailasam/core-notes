## Minutes

### New proposed meeting notes template

RM: my proposal for a new meetings notes template noves the action items into its own document to make it easier to track them across meetings

RM: it also moves the topic items inline so we don't have to continually scan up and down for the order of topics.

Action: Implement it

### LTS schedule?

RM: we currently show versions in the LTS schedule that are no longer active

JW,JG: showing past LTS versions might be useful for people upgrading older versions of Ember

Action: keep active LTSs + 3.8 in the schedule table, and then list in prose past LTSs

### What should we present at the general f2f?

- Implement redesign across all our properties
- Finish emberizing web properties (blog)
- Improve API documentation
- Releases page proposal
- Community engagements via Office Hours/other projects
