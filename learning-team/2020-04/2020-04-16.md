## TODOS
- [ ] test out the directions in the [readme for the API docs](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-jsonapi-docs#generating-api-documentation-and-testing-api-docs-locally) to see if the directions work (Jen Weber will coordinate with alexeykostevich to try it out) 
- [ ] create issue to upgrade prose in the site banner for the guides 
- [ ] dropdown should only show active LTS info ([locks](https://github.com/locks))

## Topics

### Which LTS versions do we want to show in general? (RM)
Related: https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1364, http://emberjs.com/releases/lts
- what versions should we mark as LTS? just the official LTS or all past versions?
- what's the goal of marking versions as LTS? (JW) 
- what do other frameworks do? (JW) - they don't have LTS versions
- we should show LTS and then say supported or unsupported (MS)
- we benefit from having LTS marked (Dan)
- what if we put the additional information in the banner? (CM)
- the Guides dropdown should show only current active LTS. The Releases pages should list all LTS, including past. (JW)
- that would work for us, since we just need to a way to find the different LTS versions (Dan)

## Ember API docs (JW)
- looks like the issue was fixed
- how do we prevent other teams from breaking docs work before talking with the learning team?
- we talked about this last time another team broke the docs
- we need a tool that can crawl and check for broken links? Since we run something like Fastboot on the server, we would blow up our server if we used a crawling tool to check for broken links. 
- we should consider pre-rendering the guides, this 
- it _is_ possible to run the docs locally, and the directions are in the readme. Folks could check to make sure their changes wouldn't break the docs.
- after we try out the readme, we can share info with the other core teams

## Core Competencies Discussion
- we could benefit from making a list of what the core team compentencies are for learning team members
- we should make sure that we all have the access we need and have the steps documented, and make sure we can each do those things.
- what about new folks? 
- there are some options for mentoring and documentation, we could also make it a "path to the core team" kind of thing.
- thinking about it from a growth mindset, we could also make it easier to learn and do
- Ember has a lot of in-house tools and that can be confusing for new folks wanting to get involved. AORs make sense- tooling and content producers (alexey)
- this sort of leads into the AOR discussion
- I don't think infra should be a part of the learning team (locks), it should be its own team that supports all of the teams
- if we remove this out of the learning team's remit, we run a risk of the infra no longer meeting the needs of the learning team (CM)
- initiatives board should be a blog post for a roadmap kind of update, so that other folks can join in our work
- all of our work is intrinsically linked and it's important that we keep the holistic view
- our infra supports specific needs - one goal of which is to allow people with assistive technology to learn Ember
