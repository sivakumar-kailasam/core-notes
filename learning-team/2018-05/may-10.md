# Learn Team Agenda 2018-05-10

## Topics

- Guides app launch
  - Code block issues
  - Prember issues(https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/ember-guides-prod/activity/builds/c2b6c9c8-d445-42a0-b1ef-d7ae3b23cf4c)
  - Prerender vs Caching via fastly.
- Any Ember Times topics? Please ping me on slack @amyrlam today if so…the issue is looking light https://github.com/emberjs/website/pull/3333 so a bit worried not enough content. (I can’t make the meeting today, taking a class this month.)
- Ember Website Strike team exists!

## Action Items

- [x] Ember.js Times: call to audit the Guides / Tutorial regarding content (JJ)

^ I think this is done, see https://github.com/emberjs/website/pull/3333

## Minutes

### Attendees (Initials: Name @slack-id)

- MelS: Melanie Sumner @melsumner
- JW: Jen Weber @jenweber
- SK: Sivakumar Kailasam @siva
- JG: Jared Galanis @jaredgalanis

### Notes

- JW: Guides app is deprecated (sort of, just a request for no more PR’s)
- JW: Diff’s aren’t showing in code blocks now - this is the blocker for now
- JW: Sun is target ship date, but it’s unclear if this is for certain b/c need support in pushing “go”
- SK: But seem to be some problems with prember too though, and we also need to setup Fastly
- JW: let’s open issues on guides source if there are things that are outdated
- MelS: call in the Ember Times for people try to build apps with the guides open as a resource and give feedback as to how it went and where gaps are
- JW: kind of like a community audit; could also be done quest style as well; possible to do an Airtable?
- MelS: could provide people with sticker packs who contribute feedback (poss. someone who has recently written blog on react experience)
- JW: input will likely serve as a roadmap for those looking to contribute to the guides in the future; will reduce management overhead of feedback process
- MelS: can we build a consistent story across our code samples/snippets?
- JW: could incorporate this into the styleguide for the Guides
- JW: will try to capture a couple of critical questions in a project card
- SK: can stay focused on infra side of these projects; could poss get the Guides shipped w/o prember and w/ fastboot this weekend
- JW: we should check in with Chris before doing this; also consider that w/o prember should be a temporary thing
- MelS: re future decisions we are taking a consensus driven approach
- MelS: there is an ember website strike team channel now; want to limit starting new projects that can be shipped; need to start incentivizing people to ship things too though
- MelS: should we consider providing a bigger focus section in the Times? Not too many Ember Roadmap blog posts yet
- JW: maybe remind folks, but it also hasn’t been very long since the request for blog posts; could consider some channels where the request didn’t go out on; perhaps official Ember twitter should be retweeting all blog posts that get written
