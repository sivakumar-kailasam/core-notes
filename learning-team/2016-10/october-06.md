## Notes

## Corporate Marketing discussion

BO: Thinking through how to pitch ember to corporate decision makers.  Internal/external marketing and PR.

DB: What's the takeaway in how to approach this?

RM: Been thinking on this for awhile.  

1. ember's marketing budget is Leah's free time, we don't have the budget of react/angular.  
2. 2. People tried Ember early and were frustrated by it pre 1.0 and ember data pre 1.0  and are hesitant to come back
3. Reaction against all in one solutions

BO: My reactions: I understand the hesitantcy to come back, but most of the decision makers I know have not had experience with ember. 

RM: Maybe its we don't have dev mindshare and force of marketing.  

BO:  framework will optimize much of your setup so you can spend most of your time working on your app, as opposed to cobbling lots of things together.  (see the blog post on  sad state of javascript in 2016).  We do well with those stories.

BO: I feel like our story is not getting to people.  instead react is flexible and easy to learn while ember is big and hard to learn.  

BO: A lot of the things we fight about (like initial render) are things we care about but decision makers are not as concerned about.  We need to get our case out there.

RM: 3 kinds of people 

1. new to ember
2. follow ember (though not using much)
3. corporate/professional

I tend to focus on the top two because of my lack of corporate experience.  We have some communications things in the works that will help with some of the complaints around communicating ourselves.

DB: I also do some pitching to clients as a business consulting.  Lets work together on this.

BO: trek, searls, brianc, (others) are people we can recruit to help.  Share their business pitches, etc.

BO: we should be the gold standard for oss projects, but there are real things that hurt our adoption.  We are trying to convince tech people to use for tech reasons.  

BO: we need to get our story out to people to give them informed decisions.

GJ/TJ: We have some good case studies on how ember has worked will for our corps

RM: Lets come up with some actionable items.

### Video Proposals 

GJ: Proposing a roadmap for videos that would have a good impact on new/prospective users. https://usecanvas.com/gavinjoyce/impactful-emberjs-videos/4D4pYK9DIbBr456t0r6y7l

GJ: What do folks think and where should I put my efforts next

RM: I like these and agree with the order.  We can go through details later.

DB: I agree that getting started should be first and prove their effectiveness and get feedback as we go.

GJ: I think instead of separate 15 min videos, we can distill #3 into one 45 min video that covers the whole process

DB: would we want to do a video around how to convert an existing app to ember piecemeal.  There's nothing out there that I know of presently.  Its something that react has a big advantage on.

GJ: Could also recruit/support help on these videos.

### Help Wanted App

DB: working on getting webhooks working with denali.  Got denali working as a DB. once webhooks is done, the guy behind denali is willing to pay for hosting.  will need to get dns set up.  LS, how do we set up where ember owns the app, but dave pays.  can you have multiple owners?

LS: think so, not entirely sure.

### Builds App

RM: Deploys to S3 (my acct), waiting on permissions.

### Module Unification

RM: after talking to dan and yehuda, will have a page on the website learn page (during beta) for the perspective as a user (rfc geared toward implementers).  

RM: Will update guides when it releases.
