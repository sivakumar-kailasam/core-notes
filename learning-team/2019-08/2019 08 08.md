## Minutes

- JW - We should find new champions/leaders for initiatives, should not be blocked from being picked up by other people
- CM - We could create a champion wanted label
- JW - LTS graph relies on manual data changes, we should find a way to make it dynamic
- JW - LTS period shouldn't change actually, so the graph should be okay
- JW - We should make sure the LTS graph is accessible
- JW - What is classic exactly? Does it make sense to call components classic or curly?
- CM - Angle brackets and curly are independent of Octane and classic
- JW - I'm okay with calling it curly components
- JG - Help wanted PR for Octane is good to go, we should remove feature flags
- TJ - Working with a dev on Updated **Testing** for Octane documentation, going well
- JW - Should default output of ember g component give you the JS file or not?
- JW - I prefer generating both files
- CM, MS, TJ, RW - Agreed
- JW - The problem is you have several component types to choose from, and also it will lead to people thinking you should not generate JS unless you really need it, which could lead to messy templates and bad practices.
- JW - Clarify: What is a glimmer component? Will refer to components just as "components" unless we need to explain the difference, in which case we will clarify classic vs glimmer
