## Minutes

- Tutorial:
    - rewriting for Octane ðŸŽ‰ - mainly reordering for priority of teaching concepts
    - good progress being made
    - showcasing the better component idioms (e.g. extracting template)
    - reducing the reliance on external dependencies early on
    - wrote tutorial in "automated" way to generate with blueprints
    - Any questions/issues?
        - RM: do we need 2 apps for Octane vs Classic
        - CM: question: does this just output Markdown? i.e. we don't need to do anything different
        - GC & VJ: yes it just outputs markdown so it won't effect the old way of doing things.
    - [ember-learn/super-rental-tutorial](https://github.com/ember-learn/super-rentals-tutorial) is the "executable markdown"
        - when you merge things into master on that repo it pushes things to a branch on guides-source
        - CI also pushes the code to super-rentals app at the same time
    - Tutorial is a lot longer now - mainly because of more explanation
        - we now have a natural "breaking point" where we can split it into two
        - Part 1 is basic level things, like starting a new app, adding pages, CSS, images, making components, handling UI interaction, basic testing, fetching data from server with vanilla `fetch` API; about the same functionality as a basic React/Vue tutorial (probably a bit more than that)
        - Part 2 adding ember-data, services, deploys, addons, etc
    - Part 1 content is completely done but just not implemented into the automated system yet
- Website:
    - we are going to go for at least an initial redesign on all sub "parts" of the website at the same time
    - AL: I need help with the tag stuff and the fastboot stuff
    - AL: the meeting time has been problematic for me
- Accessibility section PR
    - No objection to add it above "Contributing to Ember.js"
    - will revisit location after/with Octane
- We did a sweep of API docs to see what needs to be done
    - most of the low hanging fruit has been done
    - there are a few that still need to be reviewed and discussed
    - e.g. things like `actions: {}`
    - [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18250](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18250)
- RM: Contributor drive
    - Noticed code samples for quite a few sections of the EmberArray
    - Created a quest issue listing all of the sections that need updating
    - [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18228](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18228)
- Potential Workshop to help people with Octane Debugging
    - yay! great idea!
