##Â Minutes

- Next facilitator JW
- PR Panda
    - it works but we need to assign a group to a PR for it to work
    - RW: fine to expand onto one or two more repos
    - Question: how does this work if someone doesn't get around to it after quite a while? Is it ok to "take over a PR"
        - Potentially think about this in a different way: more of a way to poke us as a reminder
        - could cause issues when someone is in the middle of a review and someone jumps in (duplicate work)
- RFC Tracking - post looking for help in the public channel
- CM - Netlify might add analytics to our account next week.
- Deprecation app
    - broken dependabot PRs - segfaults
    - JW: webpack configuration possibly?
- Stalebot
    - JW: get a message that will be common for all the repos
    - AL: 2 months for PRs 4 months for Issues
    - FS: Should we be automatically closing PRs?
        - comments will always keep a PR open
    - Remember that if you find something that you think should be merged you can share it in #dev-ember-learning ðŸŽ‰
- Meeting openness
    - Notion document is not open to everyone
        - Used to be able to look at them on dropbox
    - Meeting link and time is not in discord
        - Now fixed ðŸŽ‰
