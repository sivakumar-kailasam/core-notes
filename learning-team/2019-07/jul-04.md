##¬†Minutes

- Discussion about airtable initiatives since the handbook
    - Chris is going to make sure the 2019 initiatives board is up and ready
    - Chris will follow up with people to port their initatives
    - JW: are we having a inactive column
        - no- they shouldn't be in the board if we don't expect to complete them by EmberConf
- CM: does anyone currently "care for" the deprecations app?
    - JW: maybe we can get an external maintainer?
    - Potentially Jared?
- Discussion re: RFC tracking
    - JW: adding a boilerplate for all new RFC tracking issues
    - CM: what about JW's idea of inviting champion to the Learning team meeting?
        - yay!
- Overview of the changes that we are making to the Github permissions
    - JW: we expect everyone to have the same permissions
    - if people don't have the permissions that they expect they should contact the learning team directly
- JW: now that we have "triage" role we should use it liberally
- JW: Embroider
    - add Embroider as a "Allows failure" test on guides
    - CM: potentially not great for Empress projects just yet
    - CM: maybe we start with an addon?
        - It might not be as useful to do this. It should be ok to do it on an app instead
- CM: let us know if you ever see the "many refresh" problem in your fastboot apps so we can track it down
- Discussion about release blogs
    - KL: ember-source beta and changelog process is amazing for this üòç
    - if data and cli followed the same process that would be awesome
    - "we have exact dates on the website"
        - JW that might be removed later ü§î
