## Topics

### add automation for the meeting notes (RM, 15min)
I feel like we could provide a bit more automation around the agendas and such.
Ideas:
- Open PR for following week when current agenda is merged
- Publish PR to public learning team channel on Discord and pin it

### update on holiday call for help (MS, 10min)
- folks volunteered for ember-component-patterns & ember-survey
- no takers for API docs (but we might have someone)

### Team Updates
- Blog is ready to release soon
- website redesign will then pause until Feb
- Times will have one more issue this year then a break for the rest of the year
- named blocks are getting merged, DM locks if you want to help

<!-- If you would like to add a topic to the agenda please add a suggestion to the PR using the following format: -->
<!-- ### Your topic (INITIALS, expected duration in minutes) -->

### Meeting Schedule for the holidays
- we will meet next week (Dec 17th)
- we will take a break for the rest of the near (no meetings on the 24th or 31st)
