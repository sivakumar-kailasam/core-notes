## Topics

### Review action items
Board: https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/47

### Review Initiatives Board
Board: https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/33

- https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-api-docs/projects/5 marked as blocked, we need to find a new champion for it. There are notes from when Jen, Siva and Alexey met to discuss, in-depth, what needs to be done to finish this project. 
- seems that there is probably about a month's worth of work to do, in order to finish this project
- Gaurav is willing to do work, the learning core team needs to provide support (esp around deployment)
- Handover Notes from last meeting on it: https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes/pull/302/files
- Robbie will look at the notes and will consider being the champion

- Amy doesn't understand some of the backend, needs some more understanding and context. Amy will share a doc that summarize, we need to figure out what Heroku buildpack is doing wrong. Chris may be able to help with that- remembers that there were some blockers in redirecting http to https. 


### Review PR queue
Tracking sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sPyN9z9wZMpTNwqCfa6R9QSPZkIW4iQd-H4gZC7ILLk/edit#gid=2035777454

### Handbook updates (RM, 5min)
- Update releases to include releases pages and Glitch starter https://github.com/ember-learn/handbook/pull/37
- Locks will update his PR to include basic instructions
- Jen and Mel both have PRs that need to be updated

### "Defined in" link in API docs are broken (RM, 15min)
- Example: Go to https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.18/classes/Component/events/didInsertElement?anchor=didInsertElement and click the "Defined in" link
- locks ran the script to try to figure out what was going on but wasn't able to figure it out
- we have to run it locally because Heroku does not have enough memory (?)
- we don't have a patch version that is 3.18.3 so we're not sure why it's linking to that instead of 1 (3.18.1)
- next steps? we need someone to look into this. 
- do we have issues on GitHub to track these issues? Locks will create them.

### external link as titles in the blog (CM, <5min) 
we can't really have headers as external links on the blog, makes sense in the email but not on the blog.emberjs.com. Want to find a way to fix it without disrupting the email process :+1:

Example of current situation

```html
<h2 id="emberstyleguide400releasehttpsgithubcomemberlearnemberstyleguidereleasestagv400">
  <a href="https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide/releases/tag/v4.0.0">Ember Styleguide 4.0.0 release ðŸ”¥</a>
</h2>
```

Potential Solution

```html
<h2 id="emberstyleguide400releasehttpsgithubcomemberlearnemberstyleguidereleasestagv400">Ember StyleGuide 4.0.0 release</h2>
<p class="heading-description-text">Source Link: 
  <a href="https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-styleguide/releases/tag/v4.0.0">Ember Styleguide 4.0.0</a>
</p>
```

- Jared pointed out that something similarly incorrect is happening on the deprecations app- he will file an issue (and maybe fix it)

### need to schedule a closed meeting (MS, 2m)
There are a few items that we need to discuss in a closed meeting. Let's schedule one.
- When? Next week.
