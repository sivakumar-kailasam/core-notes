## Minutes

Components Guides

- JW: everyone is asked to review Yehuda's components PR
- CM: the main feedback we want to get is small edits, not structural refactors

PR Queue

- JJ: looks a bit high this week
- CM: I will help move website PRs forward

December

- JJ: How can we get more people in to contribute to it?
- JW: Let's individually ask people and check if they are interested. This might help. Actually inviting people eases them into the idea that they are capable to contribute. Who could we ask?
- JJ: I could ping a mentee
- JW: I could as well, maybe also reach out to Sukima
- JW: Also might help to reach out to past Ember Times writers

3.15 as Octane

- JW: I think there's a whole list of things to do, just want to check back with you if we're not missing anything
- CM: Guides and Docs already had a lot of work done, but I can imagine there's more. If anyone has time, would be good to take a look at that
- CM - will be doing help-wanted issues for website redesign
- JW - releasing the Guides
- JW: might make sense to collect all of the more granual action items in a board or similar so we can work through these before the Octane release
- JW: Here's the list: [https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/29](https://github.com/orgs/ember-learn/projects/29)
- CM: Let's focus on blockers with this project - some of the initiatives like the new website won't likely be ready by Octane release
- CM: Is there already a draft ready for the release blog post for example? This might be a bit of work to coordinate
- JW: We should have a user-view motivation for the release blog post ready to discuss with the framework team
- JW: Can you take a look at the Glimmer Homepage and let me know what you think about it? [https://glimmerjs.com/](https://glimmerjs.com/)
- CM: I can take a look into what we need to do in regards to redirects after the call
- JW: I have a PR open with an update for the Octane cheat sheet. Please review as soon as works for you: [https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/pull/19](https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-octane-vs-classic-cheat-sheet/pull/19)
- JW: Will share updates from the framework team meeting on Octane release specifics after the meeting tomorrow
