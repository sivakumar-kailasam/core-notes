### Update: Ember-cli (Jen)

Chris and Jen paired to update the hosting infra (no user-facing changes), we're now on Netlify.
Next up: redirects for pages can go in next, which will point Google searches to the most recent content.

Chris: If it's not hosted on Netlify, it's a bug.

Jen: if anyone has feedback for the content of the CLI guides, please let us know

Existing ticket: https://github.com/ember-learn/cli-guides/issues/162 to add more CLI commands to the current documentation.

### Hacktoberfest

Updated `ember-help-wanted` to include a few more orgs (https://github.com/ember-learn/ember-help-wanted-server/pull/25)

Checked to make sure that "hacktoberfest" is a supported issue label for `ember-help-wanted`

### Release Bot

No objections have been raised, but no questions were asked either. Does that mean we should go ahead? 

(broad agreement)
