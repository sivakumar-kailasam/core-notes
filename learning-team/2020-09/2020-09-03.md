### Meeting Time (Mel)
Let's check with the other team members to see if this time works (seems so far like it might)

### Update: Ember-cli (Jen)

Jen & Chris have been working on redirects from the old ember-cli website to the new ember-cli website. 
Need to get some help bringing in some content that is on the old website but not the new website. 
Let's make some issues and give them the Hacktoberfest label. 
Once the work is finished we'll point the URL at the Netlify deploy.

### Other LCT members

Let's be actively thinking about possible new members.
Remember that we have the handbook- https://github.com/ember-learn/handbook 
As well as some internal notes (Jen will share the link in the learning core team channel)
