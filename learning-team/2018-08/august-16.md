# Learn Team Agenda 2018-08-09

## Action Items

- [ ] <action-item>
- [ ] Look at Ember Light Table for inspiration on labelling issues
- [ ] Try and run website @Ryan T @Melanie S
- [ ] make sure that contributor workshop messaging makes it clear that it’s not just “understanding ember core codebase”. Consider a 2nd iteration of the “advertisement” and language. Link to Sean Massa’s talk on the workshop descriptions @Jennifer W
- [ ] Encourage technical experts in Ember to pair with advanced devs, letting them drive. Encourage livestreams etc. “Failing” is good! Those are the learning experiences!
- [ ] Add cli-guides to the core team agenda @Melanie S
- [ ] use “guidesmaker” for tutorial apps @Chris M
- [ ] Project manage the website @Melanie S

- RT: Ryan Tablada @rtablada
- JW: Jen Weber @jenweber
- MS: Mel Sumner
- FS: Frédéric Soumaré @hakilebara

### Notes

- FS: discussions about the help-wanted app
  - MVP solving one simple issue - discoverability
  - feedback from the users - then we can discuss the roadmap
  - Ember Light Table has a good way they are using labels
  - Might need some help with the accessiblity side of things
  - JW: be careful with the use of the word “easy”
    - MS: we have a complexity matrix (complexity x difficulty) (Eisenhower matrix)
- MS: Website plan
  - working on a plan for how to move forward
  - I hope CM will weigh in on the SEO side of things
  - as we were discussing the subdomain issue: what if a project wants to have 2 “subdomains”
    - eg. cli.emberjs.com/guides and cli.emberjs.com/api
  - CM: we discussed hyphenating before when discussing of cli-guides.emberjs.com
  - FS: we can have scopes in service workers where they can only act on subdomains
    - RT: this could be fine if the top level service worker doesn’t clobber (or we don’t have a TLD level service worker?)
- JW: running contributor workshop
  - if you have a project with some clear issues written up then send them to JW!
    - don’t need to be “ember ember”, can be any other project
  - some chatter about making it easier for people in other timezones to contribute
    - pairing up with someone on the other side of the world to run another one later in the year
  - if anyone wants to run one of these workshops all of the resources are available and if you’re
  - RT: maybe make it clear that it’s not “ember core contributions” so you don’t need to understand core code
  - MS: can we link to emberconf contributor video
    - JW: yes!!
  - MS: (chat)
- JW: should my Ember 2 → 3 article end up somewhere than my personal blog?
  - MS: that kind of thing should be on a rotating “latest tutorials” widget that updates itself. And we have bigger priorities
  - JW: agreed!
- RT: rolodex - we’re working on a branch
  - getting to a point when we’re about ready to make a PR
  - a better on-ramp!
  - CM: will get “guidesmaker” working for tutorial app this week
- FS: should we use pods in the ember styleguide
  - MS: no use classic!
