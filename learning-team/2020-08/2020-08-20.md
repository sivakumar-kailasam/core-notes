## Topics

### vibe check for moving to renovate (RM, 5min)
Some of the orgs under the Ember ecosystem have moved to Renovate for dependency management and I wondered if we should look into it to maintain consistency. Toby might be a good contact.

- How does Renovate differ from Dependabot?
- Where do we currently use Dependabot?
- How does Renovate integrate with security aspects of GitHub?
- TODO: Find out from Tobias which is preferred and why (Locks)

### Ember Arrays vs native arrays

We need to update the documentation in the guides to be a lot more clear. 

- Ember A is not best practice
- Use native arrays
- TODO: find instances of Ember arrays in the guides so we can have a good idea of the work to be done (ijlee2)
- TODO: review the API docs to make sure that they are as clear as possible

### new WCAG coming up (MS, 5min)

https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#findable-help

We'd like to get ahead of WCAG 2.2 by adding this to all of our sites. 
We'd like to put this in both the old design and the new re-design since our sites are in a bifurcated state.
- TODO bring this up at the next website meeting (jared)

### from Yehuda: divio documentation

https://documentation.divio.com/
I think it's a pretty good canonicalization of what we're trying to do in Ember
-reference: API docs
-explanation: guides
-tutorials: the tutorial
-how-to guides: ??????
It's a good framework for deciding what goes where

- TODO: all team members will set 15-30 minutes on their calendars to review this site and bring back pros/cons to the next meeting (everyone)

### Ember Times

- Ember Times moving to every other week for a while. Amy is busy (her job is election-related)
- Is the process documented? (Jared will find out)
- We need more writers (Jared will give Mel a list of current writers)
- Mel will help recruit new talent for Ember Times
- consider: long editorials on one week, smaller articles on the second week (alternating)
