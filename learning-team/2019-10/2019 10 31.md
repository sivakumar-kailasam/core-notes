## Minutes

- Re: ember times and Octane announcement - assume that the messaging has been carefully chosen, if you have any questions then ask
- Octane Components Guides v2
    - Jen, Chris Garret and Yehuda have been working on the next stage of the octane guides and have put together their thoughts in a new document
    - it's a reasonably large change to the guides - mostly to make sure the mental model is correct
    - The goal of the new guide would be to make sure that people new to Ember can read from end to end and not get stuck (to learn something else)
    - we can leave places in the flow to refer to more advanced topics but make it clear that it is not required for the "happy path" and can be skipped
    - (discussion about the new notion document that describes the new proposed layout)
    - Question about concrete changes that are actually being proposed in this document
        - the non advanced content is **new** content
        - writing it new is more efficient then "excising" this information from existing guides
        - when talking about "the work" we are specifically talking about the [https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1150](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-source/pull/1150) pull request
        - Note: please look at this PR with the context that it is still work in progress and not complete, it is more of an indication of where we want to go.
        - Working with JavaScript section has varying tone
            - aimed at React developers?
            - it is easy to swamp people with too much information (in the goal of completeness)
        - It is worth saying that this "core section" is about sticking to the core philosophy and not trying to add too much information
        - "core concepts" is better than marking something as beginner and doesn't need to be marked as any different
        - advanced topics can be marked as advanced and intermediate topics could be linked to with "Zoey Says" notes
        - "the key thing is that there is a section that is an 'irreducible core' that should be the first thing that you should learn"
        - At some point next week @Yehuda Katz will come to the team asking for feedback on the PR
        - We could also get some help on the editorial side of things
- Discussion about the status of the website redesign
    - YK: clarifying of what the steering committee's role is
    - "shipping a non complete website with octane is not a great thing"
    - CM: clarifying that the Learning Team doesn't have a consensus on the plan for the Website
    - "if clicking around feels like a construction site then this is not a good thing"
    - probably a good idea to have a separate meeting to discuss this
