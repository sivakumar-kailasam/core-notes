## Agenda

- (public) (**15 min**) Keyword handling in blocks (CHG)
    - Should they always shadow, or always assert? Today's behavior is [inconsistent.](https://ember-twiddle.com/188cb0f4d46c52f14e57eb8011619209?openFiles=templates.application%5C.hbs%2Ctemplates.components.my-component%5C.hbs)
- RFCs
    - → Exploration
        - (**10m, RM**) [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/676](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/676) "Return noop function from `{{fn}}`"
            - postponed from a previous week
            - MOVE TO NEXT WEEK

            - We mentioned we want to pick this one up and move it forward. I'm interested, how do I go about it? New RFC that supplants this one? Take over the current PR (seems bad?)?
