## Minutes

### RFC Stages

KG: need help with announcement blog post

Open questions:

- Should we have a github action that comments when RFCs go into Explore?
- Should we label each stage?
- Should we inline a TOC in the RFC content?

### ember-cli-build-notifications

RJ: mention it in addon/CLI documentation

### ApplicationInstance

RJ: we want debug API (Ember Inspector)

### Link component hook

RJ: Route helpers is the thing to use, needs implementation

### Capture Based Eventing

RJ: it's outdated

### Documenting Components RFC

Breakout session.
