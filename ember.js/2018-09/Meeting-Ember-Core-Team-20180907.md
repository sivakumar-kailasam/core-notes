## Minutes

### Element Modifier Manager

(discussion)

CH: I will add language about the compatibility masks currently used in component managers to this RFC, then open it!

### Router / TS

CH: I’m trying to raise visibility that I’m in this space. I am looking at this with the goal of implementing the rest of the router service.

TD: I think lux was working on this in dev-emberjs

CH: Yeah I’m not sure what he is doing exactly

TD: Seems like they are doing some… stuff. You should check in.

CH: Yep, I can do that.

RJ: knownsalia (sp?) has a PR cleaning up some things, and I think the PR from lux was just moving that forward.

### Breaking changes in routerjs

CH: this was mostly swapping out the base classes and removing all the stuff that Ember does anyway.

EF: I’ve wanted to do this. The problem is do you end up with an ember-ish implementation just to make the suite pass.

CH: I implemented a simpler version of the functionality Ember has. There are probably going to be breaking changes since I need to rename handlerinfos to routeinfos etc. I think we should land a bunch of these changes at once so we don’t need to bump the version every change.

TD: According to NPM I don’t see anyone using this as a dependency.

RJ: Yeah I known people are using it, but not many or well. We should feel free to bump.

### MU RFC

RJ: I spent way too long talking about this on a podcast. I’d like to see us move forward.

(discussion)

- RJ thinks we should offer `{{use}}` from inside a classic app
- EF because of whitespace and such we should not quite teach it as a prefix. We should treat it as a way to change the bindings
- Make clear that using anything besides use in a prelude is a compile time error
- Matt wants to write out the addon migration strategy
- Matt has a goal of FCP by next week
- On Monday DG / RJ / should attend MU standup to cover engines

### RFC → merge

- Both are go!
