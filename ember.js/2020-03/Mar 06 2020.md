## Minutes

GC: I can try to take notes

GC: I don't think we have quorum for deprecation items this week, and Chris is not around

### Invalid state after `transitionTo`

RM: there is a bug report, there was some discussion on discord, would like someone to look at it and see if it's valid

KS: what they determined is "correct", they have to do the * route for errors, the workaround is the current state of things

KS will comment on the issue

Everyone: we need to work on the router

YK: We need a plan/roadmap similar to the Octane components plan, I will write down some constraints to keep it grounded

### Element modifier breaks HTML attributes

RM: describes the bug

KS: fixed in latest Glimmer, not landed in Ember yet

RM will send failing tests

GC: make sure the tests cover both when the modifier is before and after the spellcheck attribute

### `<Input>` component vs events

[https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18654#issuecomment-591986204](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/18654#issuecomment-591986204)

MS: If you look at the issue, we have updated some of the guides, but CG thinks there is a bug here. There are several issues here, trying to figure out what the next steps are

JW: Maybe we should write some tests. But what do we target for the tests?

GC: There is a file where we can add some tests. These are classic components, so when you send an argument, they get set as properties. This get set to `[this.foo](http://this.foo)` Unfortunately that means you can clobber properties on the component. There is some of that here. There used to be some event handling stuff on the component and it's not clear which things are intended to be overridden. Seems like it's probably valid to clobber it, for most cases. Second, input is not a single component. If you look at the [template for input](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/@ember/-internals/glimmer/lib/templates/input.hbs), it invokes other things. It checks the type from there. There are methods on the mixin marked as private. But these can get clobbered. Not sure if that's supported but it's one way things can work. Look especially at insert newline and the enter method. If it works in curly, it should work in Angle Brackets. The refactor was in 3.10. If the curly version worked before 3.10, it is supposed to work now. If it doesn't, it is a bug.

EF: to clarify, whatever naming worked for curly versions, it is meant to work in angle brackets. GC: keyDown could be a private method while key-down is what the component is sending. See [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/@ember/-internals/views/lib/mixins/text_support.js#L287-L302](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/@ember/-internals/views/lib/mixins/text_support.js#L287-L302)

YK: The weirdness here comes from efforts at continuity, which was good for us to have, and we should figure out what we want to do here long-term at the F2F

RM: In some cases, things don't get called at all (referencing the issue)

YK: All the action things are based on the Evented mixin. There are 2 ways of using it, declarative and imperitive. triggerAction covers both.

JW: if we imagined this all worked, what do we want people to do, ideally? What would the line for an input with key-down look like?

GC: If there is a native event you can use, I think you should use it

YK: It is important to enumerate the things that look like events, but aren't. Enter is not a native event and it should not work with `{{on}}`. We should look at the behavior of these quasi-events before we can tell people how to replace them.

GC: `<Input @type="text" @key-down={{action "doSomething"}} />` is how it was supposed to work.

EF: If someone wants to do a keydown (the native event), they should use `{{on}}`

JW: I think maybe we should make a demo app

RM: I can try drafting a guides PR

GC: It's very important to start with determining what worked in 3.10

YK: It's also important that we make sure it's clear that Input isn't some legacy thing

JW: ok so next steps are that RM will give docs a try and I have put this on the F2F

### Make `escapeExpression` public

RM: most of these we recommend directly importing from handlebars, unfortunately handlebars does not really ship modules so you have to do side-effectful import and use the globals defined that way, I think RJ said it doesn't make sense to use `escapeExpression` since safe string isn't public either, and it doesn't make sense to use one without the other

YK: I also think it's technically incorrect to tether ourselves to the exact escaping definition of Handlebars.

MS will comment on belaf of YK

### Improving `README.md`

MS: I would like to volunteer to get this into MVP state and ship it next week. The last status was that YK and TD were working on it.

GC: seems good as long as there's nothing major

MS: I will be conservative in this

GC: There is one inaccurate thing

MS: Yeah I agree, and I will help fix it

### All hands presentation

JW: We asked every team to add topics to the agenda. What should this team add?

GC: Embroider, which might be under CLI

EF: I can talk about Embroider

YK: What about template imports?

GC: Should it wait for the next all hands or this one?

YK: I think this one. You could explain what the consequences of the merged RFC would be

GC: MB is also giving a talk on this. Not sure if I will have time or not for prep.

KG: You could also ask MB for help

YK: I think it's good for us to frame these conversations as things we have already agreed to

MS: We could set this expectation for all talks

### [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/284](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/284) Splitting Ember into packages

RM: Is this still relevant?

EF: Yes
