## Minutes

### Router in the Roadmap

YK: we do not mention the router in the roadmap

### RFC FCP: Destroyables

CG: I think it's a good place to FCP

YK: I have to review but seems good

CG: we might want to optimize a function that's not bound

YK: we should not have different APIs to do the same thing with negligible performance differences

GC: ModifierManager and capabilites was a useful decision because now we are not sure of the ordering of destructors

CG: I am worried about performance implications because we need to do this for a lot of objects

GC: another thing that could come up is async semantics

CG: that is currently specced out

YK: you need to update the guides section, and have a conversation with GC/EF about possible future proofing and bring it up next week again?

CG: you can emulate certain async destruction use cases with this 

### Deprecation strike team

CG: I want to avoid churn from "future proofing" panic 

CG: come up with a norm for doing this sort of thing

CG: how do we plot the deprecations, do we want to use optional features, how we deprecate things, etc

YK: we should be careful to not deprecate features that introduce churn and do not bring much benefit

Action Item:

- [ ]  Do the deprecation process strike team Kick-off @Chris H Garrett
    - [ ]  Create discord channel
    - [ ]  Delineate operational params
