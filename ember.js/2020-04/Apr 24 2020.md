## Minutes

### `@ember/string` deprecation (RFC #236)

RJ: This is deprecating the global?

RM: I put this on the agenda to raise awareness that I am working on the deprecation string.

RJ: I would like to see us deprecate accessing `Ember.String`. I'll comment about the issue with a particular recommendation.

### [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17978](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17978) Make hasListeners public

RJ: The argument doesn't seem to be that this API is effectively public, and thus intimate.

RJ: We don't want to expose the old API publicly and encourage its use. I will comment and close.

### [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/13747](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/13747) input type="number" + one-way binding + constraining data appears buggy

RJ: I really don't think this is a bug for us.

RM: Who will comment and close this?

RJ: I will. But I will only comment and close *one more*!

### [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/17893](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/17893) <select> Infinite rendering loop (3.9, jQuery disabled)

RJ: This is a breaking change that we released accidentally in 3.4.

RM will comment.

### [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17925](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/17925) [FEATURE Router Service] DEFAULT_VALUE

RM: This was in the Router Service RFC but was not actually implemented: `DEFAULT_VALUE`

RJ: This is useful for `LinkTo`s to reset the default value of QPs.

RJ: We should have a discussion about whether this does the thing it says it does, and whether this impacts future plans for the router and QPs. This should be discussed further in the Router breakout group.

### [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/17142](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/17142) [META] Element Modifier Manager

RJ: I closed this already.

### [https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/15709](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/15709) Binding `selected` to `<option>` doesn't add attributes

MB: This is confusing and a design flaw, but is not a bug.

RJ: On an option when you set `selected` there is not a reflection in the DOM. It's hard to discern that we do props first, then attributes second. Maybe this warrants a callout in some advanced guide re: how we do DOM.

MB: Have we actually documented the props/attrs behavior?

RJ: I have written something about this.

MB: Can you put it up on Ember Atlas and then we can link to it?

YK: I'd like to deprecate any way you go down the prop path. And then it will become clear.

KS: I proposed that this be part of the strict mode RFC.

YK: The bigger issue here is that attrs and props get merged and it gets really nuts when merging strict mode and non-strict mode. The merging behavior is not good.

RJ: Before we implement the strict mode stuff we should have a plan for this.

YK: As a general principle, if we don't have a major release coming, we can use strict mode to deprecate behaviors we don't want.

RJ: This seems like it could be both a deprecation and something you opt-out of.

RJ: Can someone champion this?

MB: I will write a draft.

MB: I will also write a long comment on this issue and close it.

### Strict Mode RFC - FCP

RJ: Doesn't look like there have been significant comments since FCP. There was mention of "sloppy" as a pejorative.

RJ: GC has already updated the RFC to avoid "sloppy" and instead use "non-strict".

YK: Sloppy is the actual term-of-art in the JS community.

### Enable `{{in-element}}`and named blocks feature flags

RJ: These flags have been enabled.

RJ: We have to kick in on the learning side to prep the guides for named blocks.

RJ: We could use some examples specifically about named blocks in the guides.
