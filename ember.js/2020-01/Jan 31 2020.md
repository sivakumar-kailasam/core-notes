## Minutes

### in-element

RJ: The addon is now breaking on 3.17 beta

GC: I know what it is not working, I'm not sure what the best fix is yet. I think it is basically an ordering problem. The render result tears down the dom, and if you have an in-element... (discussion)

RJ: Essentially if you only target something above you it would work fine

GC: I think basically if you do it in a boundary cleared before yourself (a route etc) it breaks.

KS: This was from modifier?

GC: I think the destructor system was overhauled and it just changed.

KS: We had tests for parent/child ordering since this has come up

RJ: Yes but not for in element.

GC: I was worried the problem was generic, but I think it may just be limited to in-element

(discussion, modifier destructor timing)

KS: GC do you have a reproduction?

GC: Skylight has been failing.

RJ: And there is an isolated repro as well [https://github.com/simonihmig/in-element-reproduction/commit/1129f2cf94e800a61a189c3e3beb0af3574a6909](https://github.com/simonihmig/in-element-reproduction/commit/1129f2cf94e800a61a189c3e3beb0af3574a6909)

KS: I think it is generic b/c the legacy `willDestroy` is expected on the tree. If people migrate to element modifiers they will expect the time to be the same.

CG: Would not be a good time to bring up the Glimmer meetings again?

GC: Well lets use the slot and see if it sticks. Bigger picture I think if this particular problem is confined to in element then it just needs to be fixed, but Skylights tests have not be running for over a month on Canary. Basically the in-element thing is pretty high-up in the tree, and it I can't see what else might be failing.

CG: I can make it a priority to look into both of those changes. I think I know the inspector failure and can fix that quickly. (discussion)

RJ: I commented on the issue so it is clear what we were talking about. CG I did not that you will look into it.

### transition as a third arg to setupController?

RJ: There is discussion about if this is public API, but I think we should just document it.

MB: I didn't know about this!

RJ: Now with to/from there are plausibly things which you could do. I don't know what an abort there would do at all.

### Putting modifier after a value-less attribute removes the attribute

RJ: I believe this is a bug in simpleHTMLTokenizer. Basically it doesn't detect you are in a valueless attr until after the next nodes, I think the valueless attr is being consumed and thrown away. We have a similar issue where line numbers are incorrect with valueless attrs in sourcemaps.

RJ: The question is: Is this a blocker, but I think it has been a problem since `on` was introduced.

### 3.16 gut check

JW: Any estimates for Ember CLI?

RJ: It slipped in my mind. There are no blockers.

(discussion, coordination)

RJ: Main thing for the blog is that Ember CLI 3.16 drops support for Node 8

### TestWaiter revamp

(discussion, comments left on the PR)

### Registry APIs

(discussion)

RJ: Thanks for the discussion, let's talk about this next week and I'll try to promote it to FCP then.
