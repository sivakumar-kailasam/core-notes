# April 16, 2021

## Agenda

- (public) (5 min) [RFC: Deprecate `computed().meta()`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/441)â†’ FCP  (RJ / CG)
- (public) (5 min) Deprecation volume leading to 4.0. Mitigation needed? (RJ)
    - Should we move [emberjs/rfcs#674](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0674-deprecate-transition-methods-of-controller-and-route.md) (deprecate transition methods on route/controller) to `until: '5.0.0'`?
- (public) (10 min) Does landing Embroider by default in `ember new foo` output require an RFC? (RJ / EF )
    - Why / why not? (See [this comment](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/pull/9495#issuecomment-819081264) by simonihmig in the PR enabling Embroider by default with some concerns.)
    - I also wanted to put this on the agenda. I may not be able to make the call today, if I'm not there I'm OK either way on this, it's mostly a process question, not an Embroider-specific question. If we need an RFC, I would appreciate a volunteer who is not me to write it. -EF
