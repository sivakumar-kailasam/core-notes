## Agenda

- (5 min) [Issue templates for emberjs/ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/18980) (RJ)
- (15 min) Named blocks (RM)
    - else/inverse should be aliases (atm you can't use `<:inverse>`, but it also doesn't error)
        - GC: yes
    - should else/inverse receive block arguments? (`{{else}}` has no way to extract them)
        - GC: ???
        - RJ: IMHO, `inverse` should but we can't for `{{else}}` so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    - should main/default be aliases?
        - GC: yes

        ```jsx
        <Foo>
          <:main></:main>
          <:default></:default>
          <:inverse></:inverse>
          <:whatever></:whatever>
        </Foo>

        <Foo>

        </Foo>

        ```

    - if aliasing, they should work consistently for yield to=, has-block, etc
        - GC: yes
    - passing same named block multiple times should be a syntax error
        - GC: yes
    - passing implicit block + named blocks should be a syntax error
        - GC: yes
    - should it error when passing a block that the other side didn't take?
        - GC: no
    - What does `<:foo />` do?
        - GC: no-op, `{{has-block "foo"}} === false`
    - `<:Foo>` or `<:foo>`? are they the same?
        - GC: no, but lint?

## Minutes

### Issue templates for emberjs/ember.js
See: https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/18980

RJ: I like this suggestion but I wanted to run it by others before merging.

RM: This one looks good to me.

DG: Sure, this is a fine starting point, and we can improve it with time.

### Named blocks (RM)

RM: The current implementation of named blocks in glimmer has a lot that's not implemented.

GC: To be clear, I think these are all feasible to fix today, but we have less pressure to do so given that we have the polyfill.

GC: These are all at about the same semantic level:

- else/inverse should be aliases (atm you can't use `<:inverse>`, but it also doesn't error)
    - GC: yes
- should else/inverse receive block arguments? (`{{else}}` has no way to extract them)
    - GC: ???
    - RJ: IMHO, `inverse` should but we can't for `{{else}}` so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    - GC: I think for the moment we should assume that `{{else}}` should never take block params.
- should main/default be aliases?
    - GC: yes, this is similar but different. `main` only appears in the original named blocks rfc.
    - RM: you have to yield to `default` to make this work now, right?
    - GC: yes, but we regret letting the default terminology leak this far
    - RJ: I have not seen this in use ever.
    - GC: I think that there are consequences to not having a name for the `default` block. I need more time to consider the implications in terms of block passing.
    - RM: What would be the most conservative thing here?
    - GC: I think that would be unshipping the feature, and instead recommending the polyfill, for another cycle.
    - GC: We can work out what's the most conservative thing
    - RJ: You can't pass `main` and `default` together.
    - Resolution: not special case `main` and `default`

        Only special case `else` and `inverse`

- if aliasing, they should work consistently for yield to=, has-block, etc
    - GC: yes
- passing same named block multiple times should be a syntax error
    - GC: yes
    - RJ: I agree
- passing implicit block + named blocks should be a syntax error
    - GC: yes
    - RJ: I agree
- should it error when passing a block that the other side didn't take?
    - GC: no
- What does `<:foo />` do?
    - GC: no-op, `{{has-block "foo"}} === false`
    - GC: When you do a self-closing angle bracket invocation today, it is a no-op, so I would expect it to be consistent.
    - RJ: That is about invoking, we are talking about passing.
    - RJ: What does the implementation do now?
    - GC: I'm not sure.
- `<:Foo>` or `<:foo>`? are they the same?
    - GC: no, but lint?
    - RJ: I would prefer them to not be the same.
    - DG: I'd like to reserve the uppercase.
    - Agreement to start with lowercase, and disallow uppercase.

    GC: I can implement what we discussed in fairly short order.

### [Emit HTML comments for component invocation boundaries in development?](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/issues/475) (RJ)

RJ: This solves some problems that the inspector does not.

KG: Could there be a button in the inspector inject comments?

GC: Adding comments after the fact is likely to cause debounce issues.

RJ: Ok, let's punt, and consider some alternatives.
