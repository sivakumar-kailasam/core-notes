## Minutes

### breaking change of template array literal proposal

(discussion)

RJ: There are certain hbs features we don't support in Ember, which means that a hbs breaking change is no applicable to us.

RM: Martin has a screenshot in core framework explaining the issue

(discussion)

YK: In Ember strict mode we don't have property fallback. Even if someone relied on the feature they would need to write this. I think even in Ember it is not a problem. I think we should evaluate if hbs cares about changing this, and if we can reclaim it for array literal.

YK: hbs basically has a small core team now. It is somewhat maintenance mode, but also pushing toward a new major that is a better foundation. The group to not diverge from Ember it pretty strong in that room.

YK: There isn't an RFC process for hbs, but there are a lot of users we need to think about. We need to plan the deprecation/removal process pretty conservatively.

RJ: this-less bracket syntax is pretty confusing to me

YK: It is easy to forget about it. I wouldn't be surprised if nobody uses it. It is just the way the grammar composition work.

RJ: Can you add this to the vm team RM?

YK: Yeah I think vm should propose this to hbs team. At some point if the hbs team rejects things we might need to fork, but I think based on the current state it is not likely.

YK: Their full-focus is creating a major that doesn't have in-progress features. I think after we get that working it will be more ready for contribution.

RJ: 6mo ago I worked on stuff, and the repo was very confusing. master is very diverged from any release.

YK: Yes. yes. That is out top priority.

### RFC: New template operators

RM: Two of these have a new learning section, which I think was the last thing requested.

(discussion)

Feedback for the logical operators:

- We expect that the RFC lays out what the migration path is from truth helpers addon to native.
- We'd like the learning section to require a targeted communication (blog post somewhere official or unofficial) about how we want logical operators to be used.
- We would like a some prose explaining what the desugaring explanation is. RJ finds the `{{if a b a}}` confusing since you rarely see `{{` if without block form. Maybe just swap it for `(` sub-expression syntax.

### RFC: Autotracking Memoization

RJ: Good to go?

Go!

### RFC: v2 addon format

RJ: I think this got good feedback

EF: I went through and replied to every comment. There were a few small things that were substantial. Things I never incorporated into the text.

EF: I think one more cycle sounds fine.

RJ: Yeah we are not in a rush.

EF: I don't want to railroad it through. Especially since I just replied to people today.
