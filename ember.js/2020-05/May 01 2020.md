## Minutes

### Edition Naming Scheme

Outcomes:

- Everyone likes the idea of celestial bodies as a naming schema
    - [Katie's list of names](https://gist.github.com/kategengler/6e7501e0d0501b0f739b70fbce0f3091)
    - [Additional names](https://gist.github.com/pzuraq/59fb15bd461198273e522ac17bb338c9)
- Ultimately should be punted up to steering committee
- Alphabetical naming scheme needs to be thought through

### ember-modifier

Outcomes:

- We still need to push forward on helper managers and `@use` in general. `ember-modifier` design is not what we want in the end.
- Don't add for now

### Embroider Readiness

- RFC is ready for FCP, lot's of unanswered questions but it is already a large chunk of functionality, and we need to move forward

### {{in-element}} change

- Further discussion required

### Autotracking Primitives

- Design looks good all around :)
- Could potentially add `isDirty()` type API later
- Ready for FCP

### (element) helper updates

### **IE 11:**

- what's the real timeline look like
- security-only release?
- let's have a smaller group to figure this out more
- do we have current designs that are blocked by this decision? (yes, tracked array)
- let's talk to main Ember shops and ask what their timeline is
- LI timeline: July 2021
- Let's make sure we check ember-data concerns
- Tom will get some more info to Yehuda about specific LI apps (banner is going live May 12th on LI apps)

### **Ember Modifier in default blueprint**

- which one should be in the guides
- should we put one in the blueprint?
- what's the status in general?
- we could do an RFC to make it be an official thing, but that's what it would take
- (discussion about what the RFC would need)

### **Embroider Readiness**

- we had an Embroider breakout meeting yesterday, good discussion & result was that we're going to try to move current RFC in to FCP
- (context discussion)
- decision: move it forward to FCP.

### Fix `{{#in-element}}` + `null`
