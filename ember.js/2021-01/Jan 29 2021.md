## Action Items

- [x]  Merge [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/560](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/560)
- [ ]  @Chris H Garrett to comment RE: direction forward on [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/678](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/678)
    - [ ]  Types need to be more generic than Glimmer Components - Ember/Glimmer have a notion of a component in general. We need to define an interface for all possible components.
    - [ ]  TS types will need to integrate with template typing (Glint), if we release types now and it turns out to be incompatible that could be a problematic.
    - [ ]  We need to figure out the overall TS story first, for both these reasons.
    - [ ]  In the meantime, an RFC outlining general documentation practices could be advanced
        - [ ]  Components *do* have a logical API - args, blocks, attributes + element(s) attributes are applied. We should probably document this as the interface, describe it in prose, etc.
        - [ ]  We can ship a more basic solution, like a [README.md](http://readme.md) in the components directory
- [ ]  FCP for [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/561](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/561)
