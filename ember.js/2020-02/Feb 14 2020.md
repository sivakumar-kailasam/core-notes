## Minutes

### Controller Injection Deprecation

Will close

### Registry micro-syntax

⇒ merge

### Test Waiter Revamp

⇒ Punt merge to next week

### Classic component optional feature

CG: We have someone working on an RFC to get away from classic component as a weight issue

YK: Do we use them internally for things?

GC: Yes we do

CG: Right. There are multiple components in Ember which are classic components. The issue is that they cannot be rewritten since you can import and extend them.

GC: I think that might only be true for link component

CG: It would be a public API breakage

GC: We already broke it. TextField and TextArea are a thing, a public API class.

CG: LinkTo is also public. We can't just transparently rewrite these as glimmer components.

CG: I don't think we should. As part of the optional feature flag we should just disable them.
