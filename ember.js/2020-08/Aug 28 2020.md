## Action Items

- [ ]  Reply on [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/648](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/648) that we do not believe we can make this change in a stable version of Ember due to the unreliability of the underlying implementation and uncertainty about the impact. However, broccoli-asset-rev is itself already independent of Ember, and so this change could land into that project to be included in a major version breaking change release.

## Minutes/Notes

- Team decided to use Thisten for transcriptions
- Team decided to close the RFC requesting to extend support for new file types. There will always be new file types, it's fine to submit a PR that adds support for them. Also, we expect that the general category of the problem will be solved with Embroider.
- Discussed the `unique-id` helper rfc, and sorted out some initial feedback for the RFC author (commented in the RFC thread)
- Discussed stages RFC and decided to re-visit next week.
