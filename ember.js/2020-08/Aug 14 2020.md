## Minutes

✅ == Action item

### RFC → FCP (again?) [645: Add ember-page-title to default blueprint](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/645) (MRS)

RJ: Blocker to FCP: We don't want ember-page-title to depend on ember-cli-head.

MRS: I'm going ahead and writing an issue in ember-page-title. ✅

### [https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/284/](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/284/) Splitting Ember into packages

RJ: There has been some chatter re: this old RFC in discord. Folks willing to work on it and such.

EF: This is still relevant. Someone just has to champion it.

*Discussion about npm 7, peer deps, etc.*

YK: meta packages can actually work properly if peer deps are automatically installed.

RJ: [https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0025-install-peer-deps.md](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/accepted/0025-install-peer-deps.md)

DG: [https://github.com/dgeb/ember-cli-addon-guard](https://github.com/dgeb/ember-cli-addon-guard)

### FCP → Merge [Deprecation Stages](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/649)

*No objections*

RJ: I will merge this. ✅
