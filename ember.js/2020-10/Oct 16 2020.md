## Minutes

(discussion, action items)

GC: I'll try to draft action items today, maybe @Melanie Sumner can do notes.

### Tracked Storage Primitives

(discussion. concern over adding further functional APIs to Ember even at this low level instead of shipping OO versions)

GC: For example as an alternative

```jsx
class TrackedStorage<T> {
  constructor(initialValue?: T, isEqual?: (oldValue: T, newValue: T) => boolean);
  get(): T;
  set(value: T): void; // or boolean to return whether it did it?
}
```

YK: I think there are a number of things which TypeScript doesn't specify here like enumerability of properties for example.
