## Minutes

### Thisten

CG: I would manually clean up the Thisten notes or transcibe after the fact

MS: I can ask Leah what the limit for users is

DG: I was wondering if the quality of the transcription is better, even after all the additional work compared to the high-level notes we usually do.

(discussion)

MS: We could go back to having someone manually do entry

KG: I think we need to at least have someone capturing action items. Even if we have notes later the action items can get lost.

MS: I'll keep the conversation moving in chat

### RFC: Deprecation tryInvoke

CG: This is part of a class of utilities which are part of legacy Ember. The implication is that optional chaining replaces this.

### Leaking details of built-in components

GC: I think I mostly went through this last week. It doesn't seem like there is substantial difference.

GC: This is nominally part 1 of 2 RFCs, but I think it stands on its own

(discussion)

MB: (raises some thoughts about this deprecation implying that it is worth having people change code around ember components b/c they will be around for a long time still)

### Deprecate `isBlank`

GC: I dug this up. Today it is easier to use lodash etc. Since we are not interested in shoring this up, seems good to defer people to lodash or something.

GC: The major blocker is that there are also computed macros for these, ala `computed.isEmpty`. I think last time this came up there were reservations about extracting the computed macros.

CHG: I think my main hesitation is similar to extracting ember component. I think it might not be possible to extract this without big performance implications.

(discussion)

GC: There are probably a lot of addons using these, and I think even Ember Data may use them. They are probably so small they can be re-implemented in the addon.

MS: Cool, so this is probably not ready for FCP. I left a comment on the RFC asking for relevent changes.

MS: And please if people have moved their opinion on this please do comment.

### Add ember-page-title to the blueprint

MS: We provided feedback to ember-page-title about this. They have met our asks, ready for FCP?

Cool.
