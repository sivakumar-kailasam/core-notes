## Action Items / Minutes

### RFC â†’ FCP [Interactive `ember new`](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/638)(MRS)

Action items:

- [ ]  Update the motivations in the RFC to include more details / context re: a11y.
- [ ]  Add mention to the detailed design section to show that there is no semver guarantee for the interactive interface, the options used, and the order they're presented. For scripting purposes, the flags should be used directly.

No objections to FCP after action items are complete.

### Enable `@glimmer/tracking/primitives/cache` API

Action items:

- [x]  Enable this API.

### Enable `@ember/destroyable` API

The polyfill now works fully and is TS-compatible.

Action items:

- [x]  Enable this API.
- [ ]  Discuss further in VM meeting.

### A11y issue with `selected` attribute

YK: There's something wrong here. This is fundamental to attributes vs. props. For elements such as form inputs, attributes set initial values but props are used to access the current value. An attribute should not be accessed to get the *current* value.

Action items:

- [ ]  Get a consistent repro from engineer who reported this.
- [ ]  Figure out who is wrong: ðŸ‘‰ them, us, or ember ðŸ‘ˆ

### Discuss [Deprecation Staging](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/649) RFC

Action items:

- [x]  RJ will comment on RFC with suggestion to consider change from `available / required` â‡’ `available / enabled`
- [ ]  Consider adding to next week's agenda to enter FCP

### Discuss [RFC Stages RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/617)

Action items:

- [ ]  Everyone should read through the recent updates
- [ ]  Write a first draft of the recommended section (YK)
- [ ]  Add flowchart of allowed flows (CHG)
- [ ]  Add prose regarding target audience for a feature (i.e. addons, apps, etc.)
- [x]  Add numbers to stages
