- Website:
  - /community/contribute page - (@Jennifer W for content?) - @Melanie S will integrate it into the website, it’s in the Readme

- MS: Ember is included in state of accessibility! Ember Bangalore’s Tomster will be sponsored by JP and connected with Siva!!!
- What about the Times? Anything needed there?
- AL: We don’t really need the PR note, with Jessica’s new app updates

#### Why Ember

- MS: Can “why ember” be croudsourced? (yes!) Is stability over stagnation really what we want to say? Do we want to say “ambitious applications” because that implies it’s only for large orgs/projects
- DB: “innovation over instability”
- MS: “a framework for ambitious developers!”
- RM: the website is ours. We should put together a plan and propose it. We don’t say stability over stagnation anywhere. However we don’t have a core values page. Mel, what’s the core audience for Why Ember?
- MS: thinking of doing 5 pillars, one for each type of person
- RT: For C Suite, talk about case studies
- MS: I’m calling it exectutive summaries
- RM: important to target decision makers
- DB: if we change the stability over stagation tagline, we need to explain the change and share it
- RT: same with convention over configuration
- MS: Dan Gebhardt says to use “zero configuration”
- DB: Dave Wasmer with DenaliJS says “layered configuration”
- RT: this gets muddy if we have an incremental approach
- CM: maybe we should do a focus group on why ember. Shouldn’t just decide internally. Need to test externally to see if the phrases communicate to people what we want
- MS: great idea, let’s set it up and figure out what we want to test
- RM: zero config is an industry standard, so we should coop the common language. Will stop people from othering Ember

#### Contributors page

- MS: For the contributing page, do you have content Jen?
- JW: yes, on our repo READMEs. Feel free to steal for the website. And whatever you come up with, let’s bring it to the app
- MS: locks what is Rustonomicon?
- RM: Like a guide to Ember internals
- RM: we need a diagram of our infra/apps - what we want to accomplish, and where we are now

#### Mini Book brainstorming

- JW: help, i need mini book brainstorming
- DB: should people be allowed to print freely?
- JW: yes, I think so
- RT: do we need to involve tilde
- JW: Yes
- RT: have an epub format, have a portal where people can order the mini book printed
- MS: check out instagram photobook
- CM: first thought, from a business perspective, could companies sponsor printing? Could they add their logo? This is where I could imagine sponsoring
- RM: sponsored by X benefits the company but not Ember
- CM: there is a copywrite associated with this, but you can release it under terms that restrict/allow which areas can change (GPL, CC license)

#### Contact manager tutorial
- RT: working on this! But need help writing. Been working on Data. Wants to be a guiding force but doesn’t have time to write it
- JW: you could ask Jared
- CM: I’ll talk to Julia

#### Percy
- CM: Can we add a “tested with percy” thing to the Guide/Website
