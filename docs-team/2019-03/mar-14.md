### Review Airtable tasks 

### Select new facilitator for post-EmberConf March 28
  - AL made action item

### Ember Infrastructure content blocking problem in certain countries CM AL SK
  - Repos: deprecations, guides, main website, blog
  - Lots of other strange things getting blocked e.g. AWS IPs, issues with IPv6
  - Pick this back up after EmberConf, potentially start new infra team CM SK TJ RM AL

### heroku http to https redirect hitting heroku directly üò≠ 
  - thanks to Robert Jackson for finally finding the issue üéâ 
  - api.emberjs.com redirects to Heroku URL e.g. something-herokuapp.com
  - @ Chris M write as issue, then notify @ Todd and @ Siva 
  
### Adjusting to new Octane Preview ship dates: (JW)
  - Shipping the Octane Guides to https://octane-preview-guides.emberjs.com. Right now it‚Äôs at https://deploy-preview-455--ember-guides.netlify.com/release/
  - Octane Landing Page https://emberjs.com/octane
  - JW: Coming very soon, we are shipping the technical preview of Octane, think of it like canary
  - Within emberjs.com domain, will show Octane version of guides, has ‚Äúwarning‚Äù banner at the top
  - Keep an eye on the PR queue, PRs will be merged into the Octane branch on master
  - TD: `deploy-preview-455` URL, ppl thought this looked broken, so we had to do a last min URL change
  - JW: how to handle this kind of stuff in a more scalable way in the future, e.g. Editions ‚Üí F2F topic? 
  - CM: Octane landing page, use TBA Ember homepage redesign as style inspo? CM and JW chat after meeting. 
  - DB: Has Octane app working on Nelify, DNS next. May cause double PR problem.
  
### EmberConf learning team activities
  - Some staying at house, sponsored by LI (thank you!)
  - Use house to discuss LT initiatives for LT and friends - ping MS, RM, AL, JW to get into house
  - Core: Thursday after conf, have F2F meeting
