## Minutes

- adding express middleware to be part of a monorepo
    - if we do this as a monorepo it can improve the testing experience
    - we can test new features in fastboot and break CI for other things
    - RJ: do we want to delete the vendor files and copy what we did with ember-cli-fastboot?
    - DL: actually move fastboot into the ember-cli-fastboot monorepo to re-use the tests harness from ember-cli-fastboot
    - RJ: no objection. Need to be careful with the layers of abstraction.
    - in our tests we won't be able to test different versions of fastboot with different versions of ember-cli-fastboot. That's not a problem, we just need to decide that's what we want
    - the need for a better testing harness far outweighs these concerns
    - CM: what's the objection to "copying" the implementation from ember-cli-fastboot to fastboot
    - RJ: it's mostly about maintenance
    - If the objective is literally just sharing the test apps, there are other ways that we could achieve them
    - CM: discussion in #fastboot about the abstraction and why they are different
    - RJ: the abstractions are very clear, we just don't communicate them very well
- Proposal from @Scott Newcomer
    - [https://github.com/snewcomer/ember-alt-fastboot-app-server](https://github.com/snewcomer/ember-alt-fastboot-app-server)
    - [https://github.com/snewcomer/ember-cli-integrated-fastboot](https://github.com/snewcomer/ember-cli-integrated-fastboot)
    - readme acts as the "RFC"
    - the purpose of this is to make the dev env as close to the production
    - DL: how about starting with the "problem" so we can understand the context
    - SN: we have already built on these with our app, so that we can dev locally in an env that matches production so that we can catch errors (or memory leaks) before prod
    - RJ: not sure the Downloader / Notifier needs to be in the main system
    - CM: if you don't want to use D/N in production then would alt-fastboot-app-server be useful for your dev experience?
    - RJ: this is two different problems: 1) we need a way to restart things in dev 2) this problem happens when your app server can have multiple versions in production at the same time
    - CM: so then this wouldn't be useful to you in your app
    - RJ: we have a custom implementation that matches our prod
    - M: is this a "conceptual cluster" or using the **Node** cluster
    - RJ: it's using Node cluster module
    - SD: what happens during the update when you have updated some dependencies (node_modules etc.) on notification/downloading and "upgrading" to a new version
    - RJ: this is a problem that you can get into for sure, but only when your fastboot app depends on a node_modules

    - CM: how common is this?
    - RJ: this has multiple issues: you need to make sure that your bundle includes the necessary node_modules (wholistic all-included app with deps)
    - for dev it is unreasonable to expect that this will work without bouncing the server
    - M: does this apply for static assets too? does it need to be atomic for notifier here too
    - RJ and CM: not quite - asset-rev etc and browser caches

    - CM: how does ember-cli-integrated-fastboot fit into this mix?
    - SN: this uses the alt-fastboot-app-server when developing locally
    - it uses the middlewares in your local dev
    - DL: this also allows you to test middlewares that might speed up prember builds (html minification etc.)
