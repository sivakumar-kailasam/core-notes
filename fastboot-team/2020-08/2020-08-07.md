## Minutes

- tests that require running ember server
    - do we have any particular way to do this?
    - addon-test-setup
    - CM: what is this supposed to be testing? ü§î
    - DL: some things are against the build and others are actually against the server that is being stood up
    - [https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-fetch/blob/master/test/fastboot-test.js](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-fetch/blob/master/test/fastboot-test.js)
    - maybe we could look into what ember-cli-addon-tests is doing in the `startServer()` function and maybe borrow that ü§î

- recording weekly syncs?
    - CM: do we need recording if we have good minutes?
    - if we have good minutes we might not need to record
    - (CM gave a rundown of how the learning team does stuff)
    - we will try discord next week for the meeting üéâ

- Roadmap /  Candidates for deep-dive topics
    - what is the history of a roadmap (for the fastboot project)
    - there was a lot of work for 2.0 (maybe 3.0?) (not necessarily a roadmap ü§î)
    - recent work: concurrency isolation
        - concurrency isolation
        - sandbox
    - there are a lot of things that might go into the "big bucket of performance"
    - SD do we have any instrumentation for performance?
    - Rehydration but only for dynamic parts
    - Do we have support for streaming?
        - DL: I think we have support for it yes
        - most people cache in production
        - [https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot-app-server](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot-app-server) has chunk mode
        - CM: vague memory of issues in the last season of Fastboot meetings
        - DL: YES! some component deep in your app can reach out and change your head
        - if you stream this will break the page
    - Error handling issues
    - Testing infrastructure
