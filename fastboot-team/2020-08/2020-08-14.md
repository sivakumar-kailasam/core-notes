## Minutes

- discussion about ember-cli-fastboot-testing
    - KA: would most addons need ember-cli-fastboot as a top level dependency?
    - if an addon only relied on fastboot but didn't need/want ember-cli-fastboot
- problems with ember-cli-fastboot-testing
    - we cannot set the custom metadata
    - error handling: only currently a global error handling
    - i.e. associating a specific error
    - if you hit an error on the server side you'll still get a 200 and kick off a client side render (so we can't test it)
- Issues for new joiners
    - CM: do we add help wanted or "good first issue" ?
    - KA: we should take a pass at the list of issues
    - TW: we should close some of the stale issues
    - DL: this applies to PRs too
    - CM: I think that PRs are very different things than issues
    - in the Learning team we have a spreadsheet that we use to talk about in meetings if something is more than a week old
- Error handling issues
    - already talked about this when talking about ember-cli-fastboot-testing
    - CM how can we move this forward?
    - TW: no concept of how we should do this
    - DL: what kind of errors are you trying to expose?
        - it is any Error from your error code that would propagate to your Ember.onError()
        - in browser is it recommended to throw your error but in Node you don't want to crash your node process
        - DL: is this for development?
        - TW: there currently isn't a difference between this in different environments
        - KA: what we really want is a Global User Story on error handling
        - we can have this discussion in this meeting if Rob is here too

- Rehydration without the shoebox
    - user story: as a developer I want to make the shoebox smaller for this part of the page
    - i.e. this part of the page is static and if you re-render from Ember during the first re-render (rehydration) don't update this part of the page
    - KA: is there an issue tracking this?
