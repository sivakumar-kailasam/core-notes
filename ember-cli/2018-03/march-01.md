were mild concerns without clear path to resolution, but overall is a good
addition
- Made good progress to `ember-mocha` and will soon be ready to be one of the
defaults testing frameworks
- Find a venue to host f2f in Portland, thanks to [Mark
Avery](https://github.com/webark) and [CrowdCompass](http://www.crowdcompass.com/)
