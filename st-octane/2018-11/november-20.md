# Ember Octane Timeline
*Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.* —Dwight D. Eisenhower

2018 Roadmap RFC: https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/364

**High Level Goals**

- Edition-specific guides
- Release timeline (no big bang release night of EmberConf)
- Editions RFC

**Octane Feature Set**

- **Shipped**
  - Broccoli 2.0 implementation
  - No jQuery
  - No application-div wrapper
- **Imminent**
  - Native JS classes @Chris G
    - “Decorators is the weird part”
    - Migration codemod for existing users
    - decorator RFC @NullVoxPopuli
  - Incremental rendering and rehydration
  - Eliminating the runloop from user-facing API
    - implementation [SHIPPED]
    - RFC - removing synchronous rendering from tests @Robert J
- **High Risk**
  - Broccoli documentation/evangelism
  - [2] Module Unification as default file system layout [HIGH RISK]
    - Migration tool for existing users
  - [2] Glimmer Components as default component API
    - needs RFC
    - tracked RFC (must exist first)
    - documentation (project already exists in Learning Team)
  - [1] Native JS modules [HIGH RISK]
    - Exposing modules in build pipeline, integration w/ Parcel, Rollup or Webpack
    - Publishing Ember as npm packages
    - Importing from npm with zero config
    - Treeshaking
    - Documentation (still needs audit)
  - Svelte builds (deprecated features stripped out)
    - needs RFC
  - Routing cleanup
    - @Tom D get more info from Chad
  - Documentation
    - Octane migration guide

**How do you get Octane?**

1. Post-Octane release, with `ember new`
2. How do you try out Octane before release?
3. How do existing apps “upgrade” to Octane?


- RJ: We should embed which generator was used in the `.ember-cli` file.
